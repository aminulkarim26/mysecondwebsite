    <h1>My Father</h1>
    <p>
     <strong> am the fourth child of my father.I had seen my father to take care of our everything including feeding to education with his little salary.He was a govt servant and ofcourse a honest man .When i found myself as a child ,i mean  stareted to be matured enough to remember everything what surrounds me ,i got myself a tiny little boy who has no confidence .As i have been always thin and not so attractive. I always find myself facing some bullying about my health .My dad had also some confusion regarding my future's success, he always told me that health is the biggest asset inyour life, son. Now i do realize everyday . My father was very honest with his works all the way of his career and personal life . He tried to transfer his values subconsciouly.
